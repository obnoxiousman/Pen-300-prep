## Constrained Language Mode(CLM)
The PowerShell _execution policy_ restricts the execution of scripts, but this is a weak protection mechanism which can be easily bypassed with the built-in "Bypass" execution policy.

However, the Language Modes in powershell, work better at limiting the functionality to avoid execution of code like a shellcode runner.

These lanaguage modes are:
1. FullLanguage - allows all cmdlets and the entire .NET framework as well as C# code execution
2. NoLanguage - disallows all script text
3. RestrictedLanguage - allows default cmdlets but heavily restricts much else

These language modes are rather complicated to work with and thus we have the __ConstrainedLanguageMode__ or _CLM_.
When AppLocker (or WDAC) is enforcing whitelisting rules against PowerShell scripts, _ConstrainedLanguage_ is enabled as well.

The most significant limitation excludes calls to the .NET framework, execution of C# code and reflection.
The language mode of the current PowerShell session or prompt is always stored in the _$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode_ variable
