## The Need
Our shell are fully executing in memory and can be evaded by antivirus scanning the disk.
However, PowerShell and the .NET framework leave artifacts on the hard drive that antivirus programs can identify.

In this final section, we will be dealing with the same problem.

We will use the .NET framweork's [reflection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/reflection) technique to avoid creating the artifacts that can be detected by antivirus.

## Using UnsafeNativeMethods
Our last shellcode in memory executed 3 primary steps:
- Located the function
- Specified Argument data types from C to C# to powershell
- Invoke the function

There are 2 ways to locate functions in unmaged DLLs:
1. The Add-type function we used previously
2. Dynamic Link Lookup

### Wtf is Dynamic link lookup?
It's a way to locate functions in unmanaged DLLs by low level languages like C.
With this path, we can create a .NET assembly in memory instead of writing the code and compiling it on disk.
(yea, complicated.)
