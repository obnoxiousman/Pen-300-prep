## AMSI and Jscript
Since AMSI also scans Jscript code, we'll revisit our DotNetToJscript techniques and develop Jscript AMSI bypasses.

## Frida
we'll use Frida to determine how the Jscript implementation of AMSI compares to the PowerShell implementation.

To understand the flow we start by creating a simple jscript opening calc.exe with a sleep timer before it to hook it with frida:
```Javascript
WScript.Sleep(20000);

var WshShell = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
WshShell.Run("calc")
```

Tracing the output with frida indicates that _AmsiScanString_ and _AmsiScanBuffer_ were called but _AmsiOpenSession_ was not. This is because Jscript handles each command in a single session while PowerShell processes each in a separate session.

Going back to our shell from the [4. Building the shell](../../02.%20Code%20exec%20with%20WSH/02.%20JScript%20to%20C/4.%20Building%20the%20shell.md) section, if we hook this jscript with frida by using a sleep timer, we find that wscript.exe starts but the shell is not launched.
Towards the end of the output, AMSI returns a value of 32768, indicating Windows Defender flagged the code as malicious.
Time to bypass this.
