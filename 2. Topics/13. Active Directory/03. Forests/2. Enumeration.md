### Ntlest.exe
There are multiple ways to enumerate if the domain compromised is a part of larger AD interface.
The "old school" approach is to use the built-in [nltest.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc731935(v=ws.11)) application.
```Powershell
nltest /trusted_domains
```

The output reveals:
1. Forest tree root - root domain
2. Direct Outbound/inbound - current domain has bi-directional trust
3. Name - name of root domain

### .NET/LDAP/API
The easier way to implement is throught .NET [_Domain.GetAllTrustRelationships_] method of the _System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain_ namespace:
```powershell
([System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()).GetAllTrustRelationships()
```
The .NET method gives us the information that our current domain has a parent-child domain trust that is bi-directional.

We can also use the Win32 _DsEnumerateDomainTrusts_ API.
This can be used through it's implementation in the powerview powershell script with:
```Powershell
Get-DomainTrust -API
```

Finally, we can also use the LDAP query simply with:
```Powershell
Get-DomainTrust
Get-DomainTrust -domain
```

Once we have gathered information about the domain trust, we can enumerate users, groups, and services in trusted domains with relatively standard tools.
