## Enumeration
SQL servers themselves can also be linked across domain and even forest trust, which creates an interesting target opportunity.
We can start enumeration of registered SPNs for MSSQL in prod.corp1.com:
```cmd
setspn -T prod -Q MSSQLSvc/*
```

Then we can enumerate one's in the corp1.com domain:
```cmd
setspn -T corp1 -Q MSSQLSvc/*
```

Finally, we can look for sql servers across the foreset:
```cmd
setspn -T corp2.com -Q MSSQLSvc/*
```

With our tradecraft from [1. Exploitation](../../12.%20MSSQL%20Attacks/03.%20Linked%20Servers/1.%20Exploitation.md), we can check our privileges, follow links to escalate our privileges and finally, get code execution across forests.
