## New Extensions
The Microsoft Office file formats used in documents with .doc and .xls extensions rely on the very old and partially-documented proprietary _Compound File Binary Format_, which can combine multiple files into a single disk file.
On the other hand, more modern Microsoft Office file extensions, like .docm and .xlsm, describe an updated and more open file format that is not dissimilar to a .zip file.
