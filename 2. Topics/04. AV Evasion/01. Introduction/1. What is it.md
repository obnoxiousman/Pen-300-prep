## How does it even work?
At a basic level, most antivirus software runs on an endpoint machine. Local users can interact with the software to run "on-demand" scans against files on the machine.

Most AVs offer "real-time scanning", in which the software monitors file operations and scans a file when it is downloaded or an attempt is made to execute it.

## How does it even detect it?
Most detection is signature-based.
Antivirus vendors use automated processes and manual reverse-engineering efforts to create these signatures, which can be either MD5 or SHA-1 hashes of malicious files or even unique byte sequences discovered in know malicious files.
These are stored in massive databases.
 If a scanned file matches a known hash, or contains a malicious byte sequence, it is flagged as malicious.

 Some software performs heuristics or behavioral analysis that simulates execution of a scanned file.
 Most implementations execute the scanned file in a sandboxed environment, attempting to detect known malicious behavior.

 A new heuristic detection approach leverages cloud computing along with artificial intelligence to improve the speed and accuracy of detection.
 However, this is not widely implemented.
