## How Do They Work
The most commonly used program format in Linux is _Executable and Linkable Format_ (ELF).
To share code, Linux uses [shared libraries](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html)
These libraries allow code to be defined separately from specific applications and reused, which means the libraries can be shared between different applications on the system.

This is a benefit in terms of storage space and reducing locations in code where errors might occur.
It also provides a single place to update code and affect multiple programs.

When an application runs on Linux, it checks for its required libraries in a number of locations in a specific order.
When it finds a copy of the library it needs, it stops searching and loads the module it finds.

The librarires are searched in the following order:
1.  Directories listed in the application's [_RPATH_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) value.
2.  Directories specified in the _LD_LIBRARY_PATH_ environment variable.
3.  Directories listed in the application's [_RUNPATH_](https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2016/09/17/shared-libraries/#rpath-and-runpath) value.
4.  Directories specified in [/etc/ld.so.conf](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ldconfig.8.html)
5.  System library directories: /lib, /lib64, /usr/lib, /usr/lib64, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib64, and potentially others.

To exploit this, we can potentially hijack or place our own versions of shared libraries.
