## Basics
- All programming languages are either _compiled_ or _interpreted_.
- Low-level programming languages are difficult for humans to understand, and are specifically tied to the hardware and contain a limited amount of features.
- high-level languages are easier for programmers to read and write, are more portable and provide access to greater complexity through the paradigm of _object-oriented programming_.
- An *opcode* is a binary value which the CPU maps to a specific action.
- Languages like _Java_ and _C#_ are also object-oriented programming languages but are vastly different in how they are compiled and execute.
- When dealing with high-level languages, any code compiled into opcodes is often referred to as native code. Code produced by high-level languages that uses a virtual machine for execution is known as managed code.
- A key component of object-oriented programming is a _class_ which acts as a template for creating objects. Most classes contain a number of variables to store associated data and _methods_ that can perform actions on the variables.
